## Tools used through the CI/CD life-cycle:

* `Code Coverage`: It identifies any un-used code section from the entire code. 
* `Sonarcube`: checks vulnerabilites in the code. Opensource packages are open-source, but not vulnerability proof. 
  * Code Quality & Security
  * Generates a Metrics report.
